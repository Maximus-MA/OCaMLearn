# Project Design



## Project Overview

Our project aims to develop a machine learning library in OCaml that provides essential components for building and training machine learning models. It includes modules for handling multi-dimensional arrays (`Ndarray`), building and manipulating `Tensor`s, defining models and layers, implementing optimizers, managing datasets and data loading, applying data transformations, and miscellaneous utilities. The goal is to create a structured, OCaml-native machine learning library capable of handling various model architectures and training tasks, such as those required for MNIST classification with Convolutional Neural Networks. 



## Module Design Detail



### Ndarray Design

#### 1. Overview

Our project is designed with `ndarray` and `tensor` as the fundamental computational modules.

##### `Ndarray` Module

The `ndarray` module is defined as follows:

```ocaml
type t = {
  data: float array;
  shape: int array;
}
```

In this structure, we use a one-dimensional array `data` to store all values, and an integer array `shape` to represent the dimensions of the `ndarray`.

To support operations between `ndarray`s with different shapes, we implemented broadcasting, which enables element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, as well as matrix multiplication.

We also provided multiple initialization methods, including custom values, as well as Xavier and Kaiming initialization for more advanced applications.

To facilitate usage, we defined `set` and `at` methods for fast access and modification of elements within the `ndarray`.

For computations, we implemented functions like `max`, `min`, and `mean`, along with methods to compute these statistics along specified axes.

Finally, we added functions like `slice` and `squeeze` to manipulate and reshape the `ndarray` efficiently.

With these definitions, we aim to create an API similar to Python's `numpy`, providing a familiar and convenient interface for numerical operations in OCaml.

#### 2. Mock Use

We conducted comprehensive testing of the module in `tests.ml`. Below is an example test for the `max` function:

```ocaml
(* Test for max function *)
let test_max () =
  Printf.printf "Testing max function...\n";

  (* Initialize data *)
  let data = [|1.0; 3.0; 5.0; 2.0; 4.0; 6.0|] in
  let shape = [|2; 3|] in

  (* Create ndarray *)
  let t = create data shape in

  (* Execute max operation *)
  let result = max t in
  let expected = 6.0 in

  (* Assert result *)
  assert (result = expected);
  Printf.printf "Passed: Max Array Data\n";
;;
```

In this test, we initialize `data` and `shape`, then use `create` to generate an `ndarray`. The `max` function is called to find the maximum value, and an assertion is used to verify the result.



### Tensor Design

#### 1. Overview

##### `Tensor` Module

The `Tensor` module builds on top of `ndarray`, enabling gradient tracking and backpropagation capabilities essential for machine learning.

```ocaml
type ndarray = Ndarray.t

type t = {
  data: ndarray;                    (* The tensor's data as an ndarray *)
  grad: ndarray option;             (* Gradient of the tensor, if required *)
  requires_grad: bool;              (* Indicates if the tensor requires gradient computation *)
  backward_fn: (unit -> unit) option;  
  (* Function to compute gradients for backpropagation *)
  prev: t list;                     
  (* List of previous tensors for backpropagation *)
}
```

In the `Tensor` structure:

- **`data`**: Stores the actual tensor data as an `ndarray`.
- **`grad`**: Stores the gradient of `data`, which can be computed during backpropagation if `requires_grad` is `true`.
- **`requires_grad`**: Indicates whether gradient computation is necessary. If `true`, gradients are stored in `grad`.
- **`backward_fn`**: Defines the backpropagation function for the tensor, specifying how gradients should be computed.
- **`prev`**: Stores a list of previous tensors, allowing construction of the computation graph for backpropagation.

The `Tensor` module allows for gradient-based optimization by constructing computation graphs and enabling automatic differentiation, similar to the functionality in Pythonâ€™s PyTorch library.

#### 2. Mock Use

We have written comprehensive tests for both `ndarray` and `Tensor` functionalities in `tests.ml`. Below is an example of a test for the `max` function in the `Tensor` module:

```ocaml
(* Test for element-wise tensor multiplication *)
let test_tensor_multiplication () =
  Printf.printf "Testing tensor multiplication...\n";

  (* Initialize data for two tensors *)
  let data1 = [|1.0; 2.0; 3.0; 4.0|] in
  let shape1 = [|2; 2|] in
  let t1 = create ~data:data1 ~shape:shape1 ~requires_grad:false in

  let data2 = [|5.0; 6.0; 7.0; 8.0|] in
  let shape2 = [|2; 2|] in
  let t2 = create ~data:data2 ~shape:shape2 ~requires_grad:false in

  (* Perform element-wise multiplication *)
  let result = mul t1 t2 in

  (* Expected result *)
  let expected_data = [|19.0; 22.0; 43.0; 50.0|] in
  let expected_shape = [|2; 2|] in

  (* Assertions *)
  assert (result.data = expected_data);
  assert (result.shape = expected_shape);
  Printf.printf "Passed: Tensor Multiplication\n";
;;

```

In this example:

1. We initialize two tensors `t1` and `t2` with `data` and `shape` values.
2. We use the `mul` function to perform element-wise multiplication, resulting in a new tensor `result`.
3. Assertions check that the resulting tensor `result` matches the expected `data` and `shape`.
4. Additionally, and most importantly, through the `mul` function, we create a new tensor `result` by multiplying `t1` and `t2`. The `result` tensor keeps track of its two predecessors, `t1` and `t2`, and stores a function for backpropagation. This setup enables `result` to propagate gradients back to `t1` and `t2` during backpropagation, allowing gradients to flow through the computation graph.



### Dataset&Dataloader Design

#### 1. Overview

##### `Dataset` Module

The `Dataset` module is designed to process and manipulate data samples and their corresponding labels. It provides basic functions such as data retrieval, shuffling, and splitting, which are common requirements in data preprocessing workflows.

##### Dataset Structure

```ocaml
type t = {
  data : ndarray;   (* The data for the dataset. *)
  label : ndarray;  (* The labels for the dataset. *)
}

```

In the `Dataset` structure:

- **`data`**: Stores the data samples in the form of an `ndarray`.
- **`label`**: Stores the corresponding labels for each data sample in the dataset.

This structure ensures that each data sample is directly associated with a label, allowing for efficient data access and manipulation.

##### Key Functionalities

The `Dataset` module provides the following core functionalities:

- **`get_item`**: Retrieves a specific data sample and its label by index.
- **`shuffle`**: Returns a new dataset with randomly shuffled samples.
- **`split`**: Divides the dataset into two parts based on a specified ratio, often used to create training and validation sets.




##### `DataLoader` Module

The `DataLoader` module is designed to manage and organize data batching, shuffling, and optional data transformations for efficient training workflows in deep learning. It provides functions that enable seamless retrieval of data batches for iterative model training, with options for both sequential and randomized access.

##### DataLoader  Structure

```ocaml
type t = {
  dataset : tensor_dataset;  (* Tensor dataset used for loading batches. *)
  batch_size : int;          (* Number of samples per batch. *)
  total_batches : int;       (* Total number of batches available. *)
}

```

In the `DataLoader` structure:

- **`dataset`**: Stores the dataset of tensors, consisting of both data samples and labels, for loading in batches.
- **`batch_size`**: Specifies the number of data samples per batch, controlling the unit of data fed to the model at each step.
- **`total_batches`**: Indicates the total number of batches available in the dataset, based on the batch size and the dataset size.
This structure ensures that each data sample is directly associated with a label, allowing for efficient data access and manipulation.

##### Key Functionalities

The `DataLoader` module provides the following core functionalities:

- **`create`**: Initializes a new data loader instance with configurable batch size, shuffling options, and optional transformations.
- **`get_batch`**: Retrieves a specific batch of data samples and labels by batch index, enabling controlled access to data during model training.
- **`get_total_batches`**: Returns the total number of batches available, facilitating iteration planning and tracking within training loops.

#### 2. Mock Use

The following will show how to use the `Dataset` and `Dataloader` modules.

##### Example Usage

```ocaml
(* Step 1: Initialize the Dataset *)
let data = Ndarray.of_array [|[|1.0; 2.0|]; [|3.0; 4.0|]; [|5.0; 6.0|]|] in
let label = Ndarray.of_array [|1; 0; 1|] in
let dataset = { data; label }  
(* Creating the dataset *)

(* Step 2: Shuffle the Dataset *)
let shuffled_dataset = shuffle dataset  
(* Shuffling the dataset to randomize the order *)

(* Step 3: Split the Dataset *)
let train_set, val_set = split dataset 0.8  
(* Splitting the dataset into 80% training and 20% validation *)

(* Step 4: Initialize the Dataloader *)
let batch_size = 2
let transfroms = [Transform.resize; Transform.flip]
let dataloader = Dataloader.create ~dataset:train_set ~batch_size ~shuffle:true ~transforms
(* Create the dataloader with batching *)

(* Step 5: Retrieve Batches *)
for i = 0 to Dataloader.get_total_batches dataloader - 1 do
  let batch_data, batch_label = Dataloader.get_batch dataloader i in
  (* Here, you can use batch_data and batch_label for model training or evaluation *)
done;
```

In this example:

1. **Dataset Creation**: We initialize a dataset with `data` and `label` values.
2. **Shuffle**: The dataset is shuffled to randomize the data order, which helps prevent the model from learning order-based patterns.
3. **Split**: The dataset is split into training and validation sets based on a specified ratio.
4. **Dataloader Initialization**: We create a `Dataloader` instance with the training set, specifying a `batch_size` and enabling shuffling.
5. **Batch Retrieval**: We loop through the batches, retrieving each batch's data and label for processing. This setup enables the model to train in mini-batches, a common practice in machine learning.



### Model Design

#### 1. Overview

##### Neural Network Layer Module

This module defines a structure for implementing neural network layers and modules. The primary components include parameterized layers (e.g., linear, convolutional) and activation functions (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid), as well as essential loss functions like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cross Entropy.

##### Layer Structure

```ocaml
type t = {
  parameters: tensor list;  
  (* List of tensors representing the layer's parameters. *)
  forward_fn: tensor list -> tensor;  
  (* Function to compute the forward pass of the layer. *)
}

```

Each layer includes:

- **`parameters`**: A list of tensors that store the layer's learnable parameters (e.g., weights, biases).
- **`forward_fn`**: A function that defines how to perform the forward pass given a list of input tensors. This function is specific to the layer type and calculates the output based on the input and layer parameters.

##### Key Layer Functions

The module provides essential functions for interacting with layers:

- **`forward`**: Executes a forward pass for a given layer with specified inputs.
- **`get_parameters`**: Retrieves the learnable parameters from a layer for use in optimization.
- **Layer Creators**: Factory functions for creating commonly used layers (e.g., Linear, Conv2d) and activation functions (e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid), as well as loss layers like MSE and Cross Entropy.

#### 2. Mock Use

The following example demonstrates how to create a simple neural network with a few layers, perform a forward pass, and retrieve the output.

##### Example Usage

```ocaml
(* Initialize a simple neural network with a linear layer, activation, and another linear layer *)

(* Step 1: Create layers *)
let layer1 = create_Linear ~in_features:4 ~out_features:3 ~bias:true in
let relu = create_ReLU () in
let layer2 = create_Linear ~in_features:3 ~out_features:2 ~bias:true in

(* Step 2: Create a Sequential container *)
let model = create_Sequential [layer1; relu; layer2] in

(* Step 3: Perform a forward pass *)
let input_data = Tensor.of_array [|1.0; 2.0; 3.0; 4.0|] ~shape:[|1; 4|] in
let output = forward model [input_data] in

(* Output the result *)
Printf.printf "Network output: %s\n" (Tensor.to_string output);
```

In this example:

1. **Layer Creation**: The network is initialized with a sequence of layersâ€”a `Linear` layer, a `ReLU` activation, and another `Linear` layer.
2. **Sequential Model**: The layers are combined in a sequential container, `model`, allowing each layer to pass its output as input to the next layer.
3. **Forward Pass**: An input tensor `input_data` is passed through the `model` via `forward`, producing an output tensor.
4. **Output**: The output of the network is printed, demonstrating the model's response to the input data.



### Optimizer Design

#### 1. Overview

##### Optimizer Module

The `Optimizer` module provides essential tools for updating model parameters during training by implementing commonly used optimizers like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and Adam.

##### Optimizer Structure

```ocaml
type t = {
  parameters: tensor list;  (* List of tensors representing the parameters to optimize. *)
  step: unit -> unit;       (* Function to update parameters based on their gradients. *)
  zero_grad: unit -> unit;  (* Function to reset all gradients to zero. *)
}
```

Each optimizer instance consists of:

- **`parameters`**: A list of tensors (parameters) that the optimizer will update based on computed gradients.
- **`step`**: A function to execute one optimization step, updating parameters according to their gradients.
- **`zero_grad`**: A function to reset gradients of all parameters to zero, preparing them for the next backpropagation pass.

##### Supported Optimizers

1. **SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent)**: Updates parameters by moving them in the direction of the gradient, scaled by a learning rate.
2. **Adam**: A more sophisticated optimizer that adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on moment estimates, enhancing convergence in many scenarios.

#### 2. Mock Use

Below is an example of how to use the `Optimizer` module to train a model's parameters.

##### Example Usage

```ocaml
(* Initialize model parameters and create an optimizer *)

(* Step 1: Create sample tensors representing model parameters *)
let param1 = Tensor.create ~data:[|0.5; -0.3|] ~shape:[|2|] ~requires_grad:true in
let param2 = Tensor.create ~data:[|1.0; 0.8|] ~shape:[|2|] ~requires_grad:true in
let parameters = [param1; param2] in

(* Step 2: Initialize an SGD optimizer *)
let optimizer = create_SGD ~params:parameters ~lr:0.01 in

(* Step 3: Perform a forward and backward pass, then update parameters *)
let loss = ... (* Compute loss based on forward pass *) in
Tensor.backward loss;  (* Compute gradients via backpropagation *)

(* Step 4: Update parameters and reset gradients *)
step optimizer;
zero_grad optimizer;
```

In this example:

1. **Parameter Initialization**: Two tensors representing parameters (`param1` and `param2`) are created with gradient tracking enabled.
2. **Optimizer Creation**: An SGD optimizer is initialized with these parameters and a learning rate of `0.01`.
3. **Forward and Backward Pass**: The modelâ€™s forward pass computes a loss, followed by `Tensor.backward` to calculate gradients for each parameter.
4. **Parameter Update and Gradient Reset**: The `step` function updates each parameter based on its gradient, and `zero_grad` clears the gradients, preparing for the next iteration.

This setup simulates a typical training loop where parameters are updated iteratively until the model converges on a solution.



## Overall Mock Use

    if batch_idx mod 100 = 0 then
      Printf.printf "Batch %d/%d, Loss: %f\n%!" batch_idx total_batches (Tensor.get_data loss).(0)
  done;

  (* Validation phase *)
  let val_batches = Data_loader.get_total_batches val_loader in
  let total_loss = ref 0.0 in
  let correct = ref 0 in
  let total = ref 0 in

  for batch_idx = 0 to val_batches - 1 do
    let inputs, labels = Data_loader.get_batch val_loader batch_idx in

    (* Forward pass *)
    let outputs = Model.forward model [ inputs ] in

    (* Compute loss *)
    let loss = Model.forward criterion [ outputs; labels ] in
    total_loss := !total_loss +. (Tensor.get_data loss).(0);

    (* Calculate accuracy *)
    let predictions = Tensor.dargmax outputs 1 in
    let correct_preds = Tensor.eq predictions labels in
    let batch_correct = Tensor.sum correct_preds |> int_of_float in
    correct := !correct + batch_correct;
    total := !total + (Tensor.shape labels).(0);
  done;

  let avg_loss = !total_loss /. float_of_int val_batches in
  let accuracy = (float_of_int !correct /. float_of_int !total) *. 100.0 in
  Printf.printf "Validation Loss: %f, Accuracy: %.2f%%\n%!" avg_loss accuracy;
done

```



## Library Dependencies

We primarily use standard OCaml libraries:

- **Array**: For standard array manipulations.
- **Stdlib**: For basic OCaml functions and utilities.

These libraries are part of the OCaml standard library, so no additional testing is required for them.
